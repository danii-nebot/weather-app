This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Weather app

Learning React through building simple apps. This weather app gives weather conditions for cities around the world using the OpenWeather API.

## Ideas for functionality to add:

- [ ] Add ability to convert temperatures to celsius
- [ ] Show humidity as a percentage
- [ ] Work on responsive design
- [ ] Add auto-complete functionality
- [ ] Compare weather in two cities
